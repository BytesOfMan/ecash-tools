# joey-tools

A script and util function library designed for quick and dirty ecash testing

## Features

-   Convert cashaddresses
-   Parse OP_RETURN msgs

Background
In general, you want to be able to just parse any tx by txid. So, you need
[] Chronik
[] Basic chronik scripts and mocks
[] new npm script to parse tx
[] Function to parse op_return outputs
[] unit testing on op_return outputs

.. start though with the low-level non-api functions
